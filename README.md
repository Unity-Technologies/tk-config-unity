# Shotgun for Unity: Shotgun pipeline config sample

This repository is part of the Shotgun for Unity system. This provides a sample
Shotgun pipeline configuration including the `tk-unity` engine. It is intended
for use by pipeline TDs who want to integrate Unity into their studio pipeline,
either as a new pipeline config or as inspiration for how to add Unity support
to an existing pipeline.

The full documentation is maintained as part of the [com.unity.integrations.shotgun](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.integrations.shotgun@latest) package.

* [`com.unity.integrations.shotgun`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.integrations.shotgun) lets Unity communicate with Shotgun
* [`tk-unity`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/tk-unity) provides the engine description for Shotgun
* [`tk-config-unity`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/tk-config-unity) is a sample pipeline config that includes Unity support

The setup instructions in the documentation specify how to get the `tk-config-unity` pipeline config and install it on your own Shotgun server.
