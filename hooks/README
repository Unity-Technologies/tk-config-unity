This location is for project hook override files.

Apps come bundled with hooks - a hook is a small python code snippet that is part of
the configuration. Hooks extend configuration values such as strings and its, and allow
the person configuring the app to go in and define a behaviour in the code.

Apps come with default hooks that typically provide a plain vanilla implementation,
when an app is using a default hook, the value in the config is simply set to "default"
and the app will look for the hook in a hook folder inside of the app itself.

For more information about hooks, see the Toolkit documentation.
